This repository serves to record my attempt in writing a file manager application using SDL3.

As of right now, it is heavily in progress and has no notable product.

The end goal of this project is to create a simplistic file manager in which the user can see their files along with their names, types, and other metadata.

The program will also contain a command line which is used to conduct file operations such as moving a file from one place to another and so on
